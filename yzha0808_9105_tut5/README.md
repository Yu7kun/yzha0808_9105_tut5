## part1ï¼šImaging Technology Inspiration
"Honkai: Star Rail" Yoshizumi's character PV - "Your Color" gave me great creative inspiration.

All images are from PV screenshots

- **Visual effect:** "In this PV, the method of breaking the screen (breaking the fourth wall) is used many times to give the viewer visual conflict. In this PV, by using fractal art to show the image of the character, it is not only For aesthetic effect and more importantly to convey the character's multifaceted nature and mystery.

- **ideas and concepts:** Each fractal pattern is a side of the character, and when these sides are combined together, they present a richer and more complex image that is consistent with the real-life character. , everyone has different angles and aspects, forming a multi-faceted whole.


I wanted to emulate this imaging technique and try to express the multifaceted nature of things in my work. I want to break the conventional narrative structure or use artistic techniques to show the diversity of objects or characters, so that the audience can have more thoughts and associations while watching the work.


## Part 2: Exploration of Coding Technology

I will utilize Three.js to achieve the visual effects of Escher's "Ascending and Descending". Three.js is a JavaScript library based on WebGL, ideal for crafting intricate 3D scenes and animations. Through Three.js, I can emulate the non-linear structures and spatial illusions akin to Escher's work, thus constructing a seemingly impossible world.

- **Advantages of Three.js:** It offers a robust rendering engine and a flexible API, facilitating the creation of non-linear structures and illusions reminiscent of Escher's artwork.

- **Example Implementation:** Below is an example image demonstrating an Escher-style scene created using Three.js:

- **Example Implementation Link:** [Three.js Escher-style Example](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_camera_cinematic)

By leveraging Three.js, I can replicate the non-linear structures and illusions present in Escher's artwork, presenting complex concepts in an engaging manner to stimulate viewer's thoughts and exploration.
